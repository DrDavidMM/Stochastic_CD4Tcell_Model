# Stochastic Modeling of Lymphocytes Differentiation Under Variable Noise Conditions

This repository contains the code and data used in the study titled "Modeling uncertainty: the impact of noise in T cell differentiation" by David Martínez-Méndez, Carlos Villarreal, and Leonor Huerta. The study investigates the influence of intrinsic noise on the differentiation of CD4 T cells into various effector phenotypes (Th1, Th2, Th17, Treg, TFH) under different cytokine and nutrient conditions.

Key Features:
Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs): The model uses SDEs to simulate the effects of random perturbations on the CD4 T cell differentiation process.
Noise Analysis: Explore how different levels of noise (from 3% to 30%) affect differentiation efficiency.
Microenvironment Factors: Investigates the influence of cytokines, nutrient availability (glutamine, tryptophan), and oxygen levels on T cell fate.
Robustness: Insights into the resilience of Treg differentiation in noisy environments.
Repository Contents:
Python scripts implementing the stochastic differential equations for CD4 T cell differentiation.
Interactive modules for adjusting initial conditions, noise levels, and microenvironment parameters.
Sample datasets and instructions for reproducing the figures and results presented in the paper.
Usage:
Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.
Run the interactive simulations to explore how varying noise levels and environmental factors impact CD4 T cell differentiation.
This model provides valuable insights into the dynamics of T cell differentiation and how noise and environmental variability can shape immune responses.
